CMSC 447 Team 1999 Coding Standards:

Naming Conventions:
    File names will not include spaces. Instead of spaces, use "_".
    Classes and Structs will capitalize the first letter of their name.
    The names member variables for Classes and Structs will begin with "m_".
    Other variables and functions will be named using camelcase.

Class Defining Conventions:
    All member variables for classes will be private.
    Classes will contain public getters and setters for manipulating member variables.
    A default constructor for will always be present.
    A destructor will always be present.
    There will be no seperation of .h and .cpp files. Everything will be defined in the .h file.
    
General File Conventions:
    Every file will have a header including the following information:
        Name of the original coder.
        Date of the most recent change.
        Small description of changes made.
        Small explanation of what is contained in the file.
    All tabs will be equivalent to 4 spaces.
    Brackets for seperating blocks of code will begin on their own line.
    All functions will be preceded by a header containing the following information:
        Expected input for the function.
        Expected output for the function.
        Any requirements for the function to run.
        Any assumptions the function makes.
        A small description of the function.
    A comment should be added to any block of code that is not self-explanatory.
    All numbers be defined as constants using "CONST".
        This is to prevent numbers from being hardcoded.
    All numbers will be ints or doubles.
    All files will use namespace std.
